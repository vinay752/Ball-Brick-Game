1. All you need to run the program is a python intrpeter such as IDLE.
2.Launch the IDLE by searching it on start menu.
3. Open up the saved "ballBrick.py" file and run it, through the "Open..." dialogue.
4. You can also open IDLE directly from your Python script file. Right click the file, then choose "Edit with IDLE".
5. Rather than going through the "Run..." menu, learn to use F5 (on some systems, Fn + F5) to run your script. It's much quicker.
